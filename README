JavaScript Library

这是一个灵活的JavaScript基础库。

大部分代码源自我工作时项目开发过程中逐步积累，这个过程很慢，但里面的内容都是经过很多思考和项目考验的，甚至有些代码已经有了3年以上的历史。

当我开发这个曾命名为elf的JavaScript基础库接近第一个发布版本完成的时候，我逐渐意识到elf已经不仅是个基础库了，更重要的是，在这个库的积累过程中，我总结出了一些粗浅的组建通用基础库规范性质的东西。目前，对于elf这个单词的目标仅仅是积累属于我个人的基础库，但是对于elf代表的这个项目，我希望得到的是更多人的支持，以类似Java类库的组织方式来构建JavaScript的基础库，然后逐渐丰富壮大，并通过定制化的打包导出可以成为任何人自己的标准基础库。

暂时就这些了，你们来不？

This is a smart JavaScript library.

Most code were accumulated from my company projects, and the progress is very long. But just because of growing slowly, all the code here are thought and tested by time and projects. And There are some code which are early than even 3 years.

When the library named "elf" I nearly complete the development of first release version, gradually I realized that "elf" is not just a library, even more, by the course of its accumulating, I get some simple summary as a criterion. Now, the word "elf" for me is just a custom library from the criterion, but by this criterionlike code, I hope that there would be more and more people join this project. And everyone do a little contribution to let it grow up as the Java library. At last, everyone can use package exporting to build each's own standard library.

So it is time to say "Hello World!". Anybody join?
